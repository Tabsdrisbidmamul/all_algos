# All Algorithms and Data Structures

## Sorting Algorithms
Overviews of sorting algorithms, and each directory contains notes/ readme files which go how they work. The idea is that I should be able to remember each stage not by code, but by its logic and be able to write the algorithms in any language of my choice.
- Insertion sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
